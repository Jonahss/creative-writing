Years ago a good friend and philosophy hobbiest of mine told me that he had spent an entire year meditating on the question: 

What is the base human emotion?

By this he means to ask, what is the underlying human emotion which motivates all other emotions and actions humans take?

Answers commonly given are Love, Curiosity, Hope, Exploration, and Boredom all of which can be backed by compelling argument.

His answer is Loneliness.

Love comes from Loneliness, as does Curiosity, Exploration, Boredom etc. Many people are motivated by Money, Power, Respect, yet these are usually just things which tey think will solve thier problem of loneliness.
I had a coworker who played the lottery. If he won, his dream was to purchase a culdisac with homes for all his friends and family, and they would all live there together happily. I've found myself thinking that if I had more money, I could spend more time visiting all my relatives and friends. For both of us, the wish for money is just a wish for the means to alleviate our loneliness.

Once a person has satisfied their thirst for company they can concentrate on fulfilling other goals, like scientific research.



What my friend and I have not discussed is what lonely people do when there is no way to meet another human.

They sing and dream.
