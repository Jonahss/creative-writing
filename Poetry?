Goodbye’s can be moving, and when they are, you know you have lived something. I realize retrospectively that I’ve built a life for myself here. I have a respected job I am good at, building an object so beautiful that people paint it and film documentaries. I’m there everyday and have connections with the whole community around. The shop owners, the gas station workers, the bums in the park, and the nightlife revelers. I work all day and party every night. This is another life I have lived; I think I will live a thousand.
